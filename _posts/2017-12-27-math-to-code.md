When I'm trying to decipher some hairy math formula, I find it helpful to translate the equation into code. In my experience, it's often easier to follow the logical flow of a programming function than an equivalent function written in mathematical notation. This guide is intended for programmers who want to gain a deeper understanding of both mathematical notations and concepts. I decided to use Python as it's closer to pseudo-code than any other language I'm familiar with.

## Sequences
### Sequence Summation
Sigma (Î£) represents summation:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{10} 2*i = 90 $$

Because Python is indexed from 0, in order to count from 1 to n, we count from 1 to n + 1:
~~~python
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total += 2 * i
~~~

Sums can also be linked together. When both sums are finite, order doesn't matter. This is extremely close to the idea of a for loop:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{10} \sum_{j=1}^{3} i*j-1
$$

### Sequence Product

### Infinite Sequences


## Calculus
### Derivatives
second derivative, third, etc.

### Integrals
double integral...

### Gradient

### Gradient Descent

### Optimization


## Statistics
### Maximum Likelihood Estimators

### Kolmogorov's Axioms
calculation of 2^n for events defined on outcome space


## Sets
Some of these are more accuratelt described as logical connectives. However, I find them easier to understand in terms of explicit set operations.
