I'm obsessed with learning different writing systems, but keeping things organized can be difficult. Fortunately, very few writing systems are independent inventions: most are derived from other scripts. To make things easier for myself, I created a taxonomic tree of all writing systems descended from Egyptian Hieroglyphs.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] Also included are some inspired orthographies such as Cherokee, which was invented by [Sequoyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoyah). For easier comprehension, collapse branches by clicking on nodes. Hover over a node to learn more about the writing system.
