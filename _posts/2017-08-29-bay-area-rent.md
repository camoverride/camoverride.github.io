The most frequently used measure of central tendency is the mean. Like the mean, the median gives a snapshot of central tendency, though unlike the mean it's more robust to outliers. But neither of these measurements will tell you about the distribution of values around the center: for that you need some notion of "dispersion". The standard deviation tells you how much items tend to diverse from their center: distributions with higher standard deviations are more spread out. When people talk about home prices, they tend to stick with very simple statistics: averages, maybe medians, rarely standard deviations. In my search for an apartment in the San Francisco Bay Area, it became important for me to go beyond some of these simple measurements.

## Market Variety: San Francisco vs San Jose

The average monthly rent for a studio apartment in San Jose is $2,300. In San Francisco it's $3,100. While this seems to suggest that it'll be harder to find a cheap studio in SF, these numbers can be misleading. While the average price in SF is higher, there is also a much larger variety of housing available. Although San Jose is cheaper, there's less variety: all studios tend to cost about the same.
