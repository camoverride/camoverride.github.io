Just like family members can be organized into family trees and life-forms can be organized into phylogenetic trees, writing systems can be organized into taxonomic trees. All these types of trees represent evolution, and evolution generally entails gradual but inevitable change. This metaphor extends beyond just descent; biological evolution also requires variation and selection: genetic variation between individuals, and factors that lead to some genes surviving at a higher rate than others.

Writing systems also probably encounter all three of these forces. There is certainly variation, as caligraphy, penmanship style, and writing method influence orthographies. There is descent, as writing systems are learned by new generations of learners. And there's selection, as some scripts survive and produce more offsprng (like Aramaic) while others wither away (like Sumerian Cuneiform).

I think that the evolution metaphor extends even further than this. Historically, there was conflict between two camps of evolutionary biologists. In one camp were Richard Dawkins and supporters. The Dawkins camp believed in phyletic gradualism: over time one species only slowly evolves into another. In the second camp was Stephen J Gould. His team believed in punctuated equilibrium: species tend to find evolutionary niches and stay the same for long periods of time, and that when change occurs, it tends to be rapid. These camps have since found common ground, as both processes may occur in different species at different times.

Similar processes occur in orthography. Many writing systems slowly evolve into new systems. There seems to be a gradual evolution from the Phoenician Abjad through the Greek, Italic, classical Latin, and modern Latin alphabets. But writing systems are also created suddenly. These are the 'inspired scripts' like Vai, Cherokee, Rongorongo, Pahwah Hmong, Georgian, and Armenian. Others, like Klingon, Tengwar, and Utopian, were created in the context of fiction.

Below are some of these inspired scripts:
