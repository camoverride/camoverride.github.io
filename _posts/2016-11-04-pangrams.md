Today I'll be exploring pangrams, which are sentences that contain every character in a writing system at least once. The pangram most familiar to English-speakers is `the quick fox jumped over a lazy dog`. Although they're primarily used in typography, pangrams can also be useful for learning new writing systems.

In this blog post I'll be looking at pangrams in English, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Georgian, and Korean. In the process of exploring these pangrams, I'll be contrasting their writing systems.

This is a pangram in Arabic:

##### نص حكيم له سر قاطع وذو شأن عظيم مكتوب على ثوب أخضر ومغلف بجلد أزرق

Woohoo!
