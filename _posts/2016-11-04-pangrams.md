*Summary: My attempt to create pangrams in several languages reveals interesting differences between writing systems.*

Today I'll be exploring pangrams, which are sentences that contain every character in a writing system at least once. The pangram most familiar to English-speakers is *"the quick fox jumped over a lazy dog."* Although they're primarily used in typography, pangrams can also be useful for learning new writing systems.

In this blog post I'll be looking at pangrams in Georgian, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, and Hindi. Although all languages are created equal, some writing systems are more user-friendly than others: in the process of exploring pangrams, I'll have the chance to contrast the relative merits of different orthographies.

### Introduction

People have invented hundreds of different writing systems: they differ hugely in appearance, writing direction, and their pragmatic applications. However, all of this diversity can be reduced to a few basic categories:

* __Alphabets__, like the Latin alphabet, have characters that correspond to one vowel or consonant phoneme.
* __Abjabs__, like Arabic, have characters that correspond to one consonant phoneme, with optional characters to disambiguate vowels. For instance, the word "شكرا" (thanks) is pronounced "shukran", even though it is written as "shkra." Try reading the following sentence, and you'll get a feel for the logic of written Arabic: *Arbc hs n ntrstng wrtng systm*.
* __Syllabaries__, like Japanese, have characters that correspond to entire syllables. For instance, the word "おとこ" (man) has the following syllables: *お* = o, *と* = to, and *こ* = ko.
* __Alpha-syllabaries__ (or abugidas), like Devanagari, have characters that correspond to 'base syllables'. The vowels of these 'base syllables' can then be modified with diacritics. For instance, you can modify the base syllable "ल" (la) in several ways: ले = le, लु = lu, ली = lee, etc. 
* __Logographies__, like Chinese, have characters that correspond to entire words or morphemes. For instance "由于" (because of) and "鱿鱼" (squid) have the same pronunciation: yóuyú.

Pangrams are grammatical sentences in which each character is used at least once. However, in many writing systems, characters have more than one form. For instance, in the Latin alphabet, all of the letters have both *MAJUSCULE* and *miniscule* forms. This is annoying, and means that even if we learn an English pangram like "the quick fox jumps over a lazy dog", we still haven't learned every form that the letters can take.

### Mkhedruli (მხედრული)

Things aren't always so annoying. In Georgian, you don't need to worry about differing character forms, because there aren't any! Georgian is one of the only writing systems in which a short pangram can be written that uses every letter and every letter-form:

> სწრაფი ყავისფერი მელა გადაახტა ზარმაც ძაღლს

This pangram is pronounced "stsrafi kavisferi mela gadaakhta zarmatz dzaghls" and means "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah." It's a bit of a mouthful, but if you're able to remember each word's pronunciation, you'll be able to read Georgian! The next writing system on the list is also easy to learn and create pangrams in, although it functions on a different basic logic.

### Hangul (한글)

Hangul, the Korean alphabet, like English and Georgian, has characters that correspond to individual consonants or vowels. However, unlike other alphabets, Korean characters are squished together into blocks. This is an awesome advantage because it makes syllable boundaries easy to interpret. The word "김치"" (kimchi) has two syllables, "김" and "치". Unlike Chinese, each of these blocky units can be broken down into different letters. The "김" syllable consists of the letters ㄱ = k (g), ㅣ = i, and ㅁ = m.

Like Georgian, it's easy to create a pangram that contains all the letters of the alphabet:

> KOREAN PANGRAM!!!

This pangram is pronounced "XXXXXXX" and means "XXXXXXX."

However, there's a small hitch. Because Korean characters are all squeezed into super-convenient syllable blocks, they get warped slightly depending on their location in the block. Our letter ㄱ (g) is different when it's in the syllable "길" (*gil*, road), "굴" (*gool*, oyster), and "궐" (*gwol*, palace):

For a typographer creating a new font, the flexibility of Korean letters might be a nightmare. But for a language learner this flexibility doesn't cause much difficulty. In fact, Korean is one of the easiest alphabetic writing systems to learn.

### Hiragana (ひらがな)

Japanese is written in several different ways. One of these is hirigana, a syllabary. 



...

While Hirigana might be one of the easiest syllabaries to learn, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to writing Japanese. Not only does Japanese have another parallel syllabary (katakana), but Japanese also uses thousands of Chinese logograms. These logograms have multiple written forms and come packaged with complex rules governing how their pronunciation changes based on context. 

### Arabic (العربية)

Like Korean, Arabic letters change their form based on their location in a word. However, the changes that Arabic letters make are much greater.

technically, because the vowels ride on top of the letters, a strict pangram would need to include every letter of arabic. However, because the rules for addind vowels is simple, this isn't really necessary. letter forms

### Devanagari (देवनागरी)

some of the same problems with forming pangrams in arabic are also present in devanagari. In the strictest sense, you would need to include not only all the base syllables, but also all syllables with vowel-modifying diacritics. On top of that. you'll have to include all of the language's ligatures ...

similar to japanese ordering! historical connection??? (Buddhism?)

### Chinese

too bad! reflect on how certain writing systems are tailored to their languages, but languages with complex syllables (Mycenean Greek) demanded the invention of alphabets, which are by their nature more flexible


Chinese is an example of a system that's simple in principle but unweildly in practice. It's like one of those late-night debates you might have in college: *hey man, why don't we just abolish the police, we can all just work things out like we do in the dorms.* On a limited scale the principle couldn't be simpler: one word, one symbol, one pronunciation. However, when you begin to scale things up, the system gets annoying. Abolishing the police might be an okay idea on a college campus that has counsellors, faculty, and security staff, but it doesn't work when scaled up to all of the United States. Logograms might be appealing when you have only a few words, but actual languages have tens of thousands of words. 




conclusion: pangrams are best suited for alphabets. It's also easy for Japanese, as the language *lucks out* by having a simple syllable structure. 

Korean is the best writing system in the context of its language: transparent syllables are a huge advantage.

Georgian is the best writing system in the context of world languages, because it can be adapted to any writing system and doesn't have useless capitals -- however, the syllables aren't transparent.


To learn every character in Russian, understand that the pangram *"Разъяренный чтец эгоистично бьёт пятью жердями шустрого фехтовальщика"* is pronounced *razyarenni chtets egoictichna byot pyatyu zherdymi shustroga fehtobalshika*.

There are multiple universes but they never interact with each other. There is a physical realm ruled by the demiurge and the universe of light which is the domain of the creator. The physical world is corrupt and the world of light is pure. These two worlds don't interact *except when they do*. If multiverses interact, aren't they parts of the same universe?

This is a pangram in Arabic:

> نص حكيم له سر قاطع وذو شأن عظيم مكتوب على ثوب أخضر ومغلف بجلد أزرق

It's read as *"hola bueno me gusta dis margartia por favor"*.

Woohoo!

The English alphabet is organized in one dimension, a single string that starts with `a` and ends with `z`. Hindi, on the other hand, is much more interesting. Devenagari is organized along two dimensions, manner and place of articulation, a structural organization which underlies our modern understanding of phonology.

* __Alphabets__, like the Latin alphabet, have characters that correspond to one vowel or consonant phoneme. For instance, the word "Red" has the following correspondences in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA): *R* = /ɹ/, *e* = /ɛ/, *d* = /d/, (IPA: /ɹɛd/).
* __Abjabs__, like Arabic, have characters that correspond to one consonant phoneme, with optional characters to disambiguate vowels. For instance, the word "شكرا" (thanks) has the following correspondences: *ش* = /ʃ/, *ك* = /k/, *ر* = /r/, *ا* = /aː/. Although written literally as "shkra" (IPA: /ʃkraː/), the vowels and final nasal consonant are inferred, and the word is correctly pronounced as "shukran" (IPA: /ʃukraːn/).
* __Syllabaries__, like Japanese, have characters that correspond to entire syllables. For instance, the word "おとこ" (man) has the following correspondences: *お* = /o/, *と* = /to/, *こ* = /ko/.
* __Alpha-syllabaries__ (or abugidas), like Devanagari, have characters that correspond to 'base syllables'. The vowels of these 'base syllables' can then be modified with diacritics.
* __Logographies__, like Chinese, have characters that correspond to entire words or morphemes.
