This is a taxonomic tree of all the writing systems descended from Proto-Canaanite.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] It does not include some inspired orthographies such as Cherokee, which was invented by [Sequoyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoyah). For easier comprehension, collapse branches by clicking on nodes.
