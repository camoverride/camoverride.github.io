Lalish is the holiest place in the Yezidi religion. It is the mountain where Melek Taus, the demiurge responsible for the creation of the world, first descended from the incorruptable realm of light. Among the shrines that dot the landscape are a number of mysterious symbols that locals were unable to explain to me.


#### A carving of an animal.

This animal is tied by the neck, which might indicate that it is being given as an offering.
