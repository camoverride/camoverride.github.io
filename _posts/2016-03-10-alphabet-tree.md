This is a taxonomic tree of all the writing systems descended from Proto-Canaanite. It does not include some inspired orthographies such as Cherokee, which was invented by [Sequoyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoyah). This tree has hundreds of nodes, so it is recommended that you zoom out to view this page. Press `ctrl -` or `ctrl +` on your keyboard.
