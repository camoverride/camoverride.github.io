<p>I'm Cameron, and this is my personal website. Here are some things that interest me:</p>

<h5>Language</h5>
One day I'll pass the turing test. If Pirahã lacks grammatical recursion, does that mean that it's on the "pushdown automata" level of the Chomsky hierarchy? Naive Bayes is my favorite ML algorithm, but I'll never get tired of CFG's:

$$ G = (V, \Sigma, R, S) $$

<h5>Math</h5>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor's approach</a> to set theory is really interesting. I recently discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russel's Paradox</a> is reflected in SQL's `GROUP BY` function. This is the pmf for my favorite probability distribution:

$$ \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$

<h5>Code</h5>
Coroutines are really great. I'm getting more comfortable with Node.js. I recently discovered Python's Multiprocessing library and am falling in love. (I still haven't finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">sicp</a>.)
~~~python
def coroutine():
    hi = yield 'Hello'
    yield hi

co = coroutine()
next(co)
print(co.send('World'))

<h5>Languages</h5>

<p>I have a background in linguistics and am always thinking about the diversity of the world's languages. The click consonants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoekhoe_language#Clicks">Khoekhoe</a> are fascinating, as are the enormous number of consonants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_phonology">Ubykh</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_personal_pronouns">Austronesian personal pronouns</a> are crazy, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_language">Pirahã's</a> grammar will make your head spin. Writing systems are great as well. I've spent way too much time learning to write ligatures in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">देवनागरी</a> and all the shapes that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">العربية</a> letters can take.</p> 

<h5>Science</h5>

<p>In Elementary school I started reading Sagan, Dawkins, and Jared Diamond. In 5th grade I was punished for sneaking away to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">The Selfish Gene</a> when I was supposed to be in gym class. My interest in anthropology eventually changed to biology and then psychology by the time I became a university student. I've spent a lot of time since then working in labs, reading research papers, and flipping through my old books.</p>

<h5>Hitchhiking</h5>

<p>When I'm traveling overseas or if I'm in the Bay Area without my car, I like to get around by <a href="http://hitchwiki.org/en/User:Camoverride">hitchhiking</a>. This is a great way to meet new people and have experiences that are otherwise impossible! The media depicts hitchhiking as a high-risk activity, but this couldn't be further from the truth. I've been offered beds to sleep in, meals to eat, and free tours while thumbing rides.</p>

<h5>Food</h5>

<p>A few years ago I discovered dumpster-diving and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Q4CKg"> I've been hooked ever since</a>. People throw away perfectly edible food every day, and it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._Greenwood">yours for the taking</a>. Dumpster-diving is an urban treasure hunt: it's legal, safe, easy, and not particularly disgusting. I've found everything from piles of vegan sausages to mannequins sitting in the trash. I have a mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism#Veganism_and_food_waste">freegan</a> diet and use the money I save on food to buy books.</p>

<h5>Literature</h5>

<p>I spend an unhealthy amount of time <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59411167-cameron-smith">reading</a> and writing. Eco, Vidal, Vonnegut, Nabokov, Eugenides, and Tolstoy are some of my favorites. After reading through the Greek and Roman classics, I've gotten more interested in Islamic literature: Al-Ghazali, Ferdowsi, Ibn Khaldun, and Ibn Tufail are fascinating. Everyone should read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah"> Muqaddimah</a>.</p>

<h5>Maps</h5>

<p>When I was a kid my grandfather gave me a history book with a map on every single page. I learned that maps are the perfect way to represent all sorts of information: the spread of civilization, the course of battles, the movement of populations, and more. The hard part about understanding the world isn't memorizing facts: it's packaging them into coherent stories. Maps are one way of doing that, as are charts, graphs, and other ways of representing data.</p>
