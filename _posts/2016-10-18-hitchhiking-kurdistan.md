#### Mor Gabriel

I had the chance to meet the patriarch of Mor Gabriel, an Assyrian Christian monastary in Turkey.

#### Qizqapan

Rumored to be the tomb of Median King Cyaxares. Cyaxares' forces clashed with the Lydians in the battle of Halys. The Lydians and Medians agreed to stop the battle when an eclipse occurred. [The Eclipse of Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales) is the oldest historical event that is known to the exact day.

#### Checkpoints

Peshmerga soldiers control the roads, making Iraqi Kurdistan one of the safest places in the Middle East. Many Kurds are fond of the Bush administration for destroying the regime of Saddam Hussein -- as the rest of Iraq has descended into chaos, the invasion has allowed Kurdistan to flourish.

The main market in Sulaymaniyah, cultural capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.
