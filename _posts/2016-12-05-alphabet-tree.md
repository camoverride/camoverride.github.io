I'm obsessed with learning different writing systems, but keeping things organized can be difficult. Fortunately, very few writing systems are independent inventions: most are derived from other scripts. To make things easier for myself, I created a taxonomic tree of all writing systems descended from Egyptian Hieroglyphs.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2] Also included are some inspired orthographies such as Cherokee, which was invented by [Sequoyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoyah).

### Method

While many of these writing systems have historically attested geneologies, I had to apply some guesswork in assembling this tree. I relied on Wikipedia as both a source itself and as a platform for finding primary sources (many of these primary sources weren't properly reflected in the Wikipedia articles citing them, requiring me to edit a few articles).
