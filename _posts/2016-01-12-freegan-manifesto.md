It's not about instantly jumping to your destination, it's about the journey. Fabian, not revolutionary.
Almost all of us are born into consumerism: it's the default. The solution isn't to suddenly drop everything and move into the woods -- even Thoreau left Walden to buy supplies from town. It's identifying the unhealthy/immoral/bad aspects of your behavior and slowly eliminating them,

What food do you eat?
- learn to cook from raw ingredients
- animal products
- make sure that those ingredients are gathered in a responsible way
- maybe even dumpster dive them!

How do you get around?
- Do you drive a car? Is it electric?
- Do you have the option of walking, taking a bus?

What do you buy?
- 

What do you throw away?
- composting
- re-using bottles
- etc.

Bookchin - 
Scarcity = physical resoueces. Things like prestige, fame, respect, sex might always be scarce -- not everyone can be famous, as that literally contradicts the definition of fame

We're living on the edge of post-scarcity, but that doesn't mean that one day we'll wake up and all scarcity will suddenly be gone -- some resources will stop being scarce before others.
	Some things were abundant but are now scarce: land, irrigable water, precious minerals, large quadrapeds.
	Some thhings are abundant and were never scarce: sunlight, oxygen.
	Some things have always been scarce but are now becoming abundant:
		Drinking water, in America, is no longer scarce -- get in anywhere for free.
		Food, in many parts of America, is free -- dumpster diving.
		Furniture, in most places, is free -- craigslist.
		Information, through the internet [not physical resource, still important]

		Make sure you aren’t taking food from someone who really needs it if you don’t, but most places have a lot of extra to go around.

Hitchhiking - transport could be post-scarcity (mention Uber)

Squatting -- if it's empty, take it!

Tangents - 

Most stories have a cyclical narrative -
	marriage plot, in beginning, reflects upon relationship plots, in the end ties this together, even though the body of the work is spent elsewhere
	jane eyre, meets GUY, spends time with cousin, goes back to guy.

	sometimes a story ends with a tangent -- it doesnt circle back upon itself. this is okay - journey is sometimes more important than the destination
