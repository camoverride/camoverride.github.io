The United Nations Population Division [has predicted](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/) that the world's population will likely rise to more than 11 billion by the end of this century. While most parts of the world will experience population growth, some places will experience more growth than others. Niger is expected to grow from a population of 24 million in 2020 to around 200 million in 2100. Many countries, such as Botswana, will grow close to the world's average rate of 145%. On the other hand Moldova's population will decline from four million to less than two million: the greatest decline of any country.[^1]

[^1]: Wikipedia provides [a table of growth rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant)).
I've picked through the UN data to produce some interesting maps. This first map illustrates simple growth rates. It shows the population in 2100 as a percentage of the population in 2020.
