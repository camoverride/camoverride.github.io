This is my proposal for Gleanr, a crowdsourcing mobile app to reduce food waste. Givers -- farmers, grocery store managers, and restaurant owners -- can post givings. Other people -- Gleaners -- can pick up these givings. Gleanr acts as the middleman between Givers and Gleaners, diverting food waste in the process.

## The Problem

Every year in the United States, almost half of all edible food goes to waste[^1]. This waste accounts for more than 30% of total freshwater consumption,[^2] 16% of methane gas emissions,[^3] and 165 billion dollars.[^4] Around 20% of all the land in the United States -- an area almost four times the size of California -- is used to produce food that goes to waste.[^5]

Food waste occurs on many different levels. In California, up to 20% of fruits and vegetables are lost during harvesting, 15% during distribution, and 20% after being purchased by consumers.[^6] Waste like this is a result of structural problems built into the world’s food production system. These problems include inefficiencies in automatic harvesting, unpredictable costs of farm labor, unrealistic aesthetic standards of consumers, and misleading expiration dates. This enormous amount of waste is not only an important factor in the ongoing California drought, but is a major contributor to global climate change.

At the same time, millions of Americans lack access to healthy food.[^7] In rural communities like Merced, California, a sizable proportion of the population live in food deserts[^8] while healthy, edible food is left to rot in farms only a short distance away. I don’t think that contradictions like this need to exist.

## Existing Solutions

There already exist organizations that divert food waste. These include The Society of St. Andrew, North Berkeley Harvest, Food Forward, Imperfect Produce, and many others.[^9]

Senior Gleaners was a charitable group that organized volunteers to help glean fields. These gleanings were then distributed to local food banks and homeless shelters. This organization was effective in working with farmers, harvesting food, and distributing it. However, this organization, like many other gleaning groups, had a limited lifespan and is now defunct. Senior Gleaners was unable to remain in operation because of difficulties in finding volunteer labor and volunteer distributors in a timely enough manner to ensure that foods did not spoil.[^10] 

Other groups such as the Food Recovery Network connect food-waste producers with food banks. There are many of these types of groups; United We Serve even provides resources and grants to help start local food-recovery groups.[^11] However, like gleaning groups, these groups face organizational challenges. Not all food waste is successfully recovered as recovery is dependent upon hours donated by volunteers.

## Proposed Innovation 

My solution to this problem is Gleanr, a web application that allows individuals to collect edible food waste themselves. People and organizations that produce food waste, such as restuarants, farmers, and conferences (called Givers) can list their givings online. Other users, called Gleaners, can search through these givings and collect them.

Gleanr is not a replacement for charitable food-rescue groups: it's a tool that can be used by both individuals and nonprofit organizations in order to take advantage of givings. Only a tiny fraction of the food waste produced annually is successfully rescued. 

## Interface

Gleanr will have a simple and intuitive interface. Users can filter by type of food and age of the posting. Charitable organizations will also have the option of reserving specific gleanings for themselves.

Donors will have the option of listing the type of gleaning, its location, and the date the gleaning will become available. Gleanr will build a large network of farmers to create a densely populated map of food gleanings.

## Obstacles

Gleanr may face legal obstacles. If, for instance, an individual is injured while gleaning food from a field, the farmer may be liable. However, this legal liability can be mitigated in several ways. The first way involves a release of liability form that gleaners must consent to online before creating a Gleanr account. Contemporary gleaning groups also require their members to sign similar documents.[^12] Additionally, the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act releases food donors from legal liability as long as their donation was made in good faith.[^13] Gleanr can be incorporated as a non-profit, allowing it to take advantage of the Good Samaritan Act.

## Conclusion

If everything goes according to plan, Gleanr might act like the 'free stuff' section of Craigslist, but for food waste. Instead of tossing your extra avocados in the trash, it will be easy to leave them on a street corner and allow others to pick them up. Fields post-harvest will be accesible by city-dwellers who take trips into the countryside and might want to try some gleaning. Hopefully Gleanr will divert more edible food from garbage cans to stomachs.
