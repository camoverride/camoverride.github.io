#### Mor Gabriel

I met the patriarch of Mor Gabriel, an Assyrian Christian monastary in Turkey.

#### Qizqapan

Qizqapan is rumored to be the tomb of Median King Cyaxares. Cyaxares' forces clashed with the Lydians in the battle of Halys. During the battle, an eclipse occurred. Interpreting this as an omen, the opposing sides agreed to stop the bloodshed. [The Eclipse of Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales) is the oldest historical event that is known to the exact day. The Ionian columns that flank the tomb's entrance predate any Ionian columns in Greece, which has led some historians to include that this architectural style was invented by the Medians, not the Greeks.

#### Checkpoints

Peshmerga soldiers control the roads, making Iraqi Kurdistan one of the safest places in the Middle East. Many Kurds are fond of the Bush administration for ending the regime of Saddam Hussein -- although the invasion has caused the rest of Iraq to descent into chaos, Kurdistan was able to free itself from the weakened central government and to flourish independently.
