The United Nations Population Division has predicted[^1] that the world's population will likely rise to more than 11 billion by the end of this century. While most countries will experience population growth, some will experience more growth than others. Niger is expected to grow from a population of 24 million in 2020 to around 200 million in 2100. Countries such as Botswana will grow close to the world's average rate of 145%. On the other hand, Moldova's population will decrease from four million to less than two million: the greatest decline of any country.[^2] The map below shows the population of countries in 2100 as a percentage of their population in 2020.

The next map shows the population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>) of countries in 2100. In 2020, many of the most densely-populated large countries will be in South Asia (India, Bangladesh), East Asia (South Korea, Japan), and Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands). On the other hand, in 2100 many of the densest countries will be in Africa (Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria).
