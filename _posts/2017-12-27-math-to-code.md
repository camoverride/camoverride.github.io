When I'm trying to decipher some hairy math formula, I find it helpful to translate the equation into code. In my experience, it's often easier to follow the logical flow of a programming function than an equivalent function written in mathematical notation. This guide is intended for programmers who want to gain a deeper understanding of mathematical notations and concepts. I decided to use Python as it's closer to pseudo-code than any other language I'm familiar with.
