When I was sixteen years-old, I spent a lot of time thinking about the political history of the world. Somalia, a country administered primarily through a system of customary law called *Xeer* instead of by a state, was *cool*. The Cold War, where the United States and the Soviet Union fought each other through a series of proxy conflicts, was *badass*. The rise of communism in Russia and the subsequent industrial revolution, Stalinist purges, space-race, and demolition of organized religion was *fucking awesome*.

If, as a sixteen year-old boy, I'd been asked to design my own country, I would have probably cobbled together something resembling Transnistria.
