*Summary: My attempt to find pangrams in several languages reveals interesting differences between writing systems. At the end are tables that will help with alphabet-learning.*



Today I'll be exploring pangrams, which are sentences that contain every character in a writing system at least once. The pangram most familiar to English-speakers is *"the quick fox jumped over a lazy dog."* Although they're primarily used in typography, pangrams can also be useful for learning new writing systems.

In this blog post I'll be looking at pangrams in Georgian, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, and Hindi. Although all languages are created equal, some writing systems are more user-friendly than others: in the process of exploring pangrams, I'll have the chance to contrast the relative merits of different orthographies.



### Introduction

People have invented hundreds of different writing systems: they differ hugely in appearance, writing direction, and their pragmatic applications. However, all of this diversity can be reduced to a few basic categories:

* __Alphabets__ have characters that correspond to one vowel or consonant phoneme.
* __Abjabs__ have characters that correspond to one consonant phoneme, with optional characters to disambiguate vowels. For instance, the Arabic word **شكرا** (thanks) is pronounced *shukran*, even though it is written as *shkra*. Try reading the following sentence, and you'll get a feel for the logic of written Arabic: *Arbc hs n ntrstng wrtng systm*.
* __Syllabaries__ have characters that correspond to entire syllables. For instance, the Japanese word **おとこ** (man) has the following syllables: **お** = *o*, **と** = *to*, and **こ** = *ko*.
* __Abugidas__ (or alphasyllabaries) have 'base syllables'. The vowels of these 'base syllables' can then be modified with diacritics. For instance, you can modify the Devanagari base syllable **ल** (pron. *la*) in several ways: **ले** = *le*, **लु** = *lu*, **ली** = *lee*, etc. 
* __Logographies__ have characters that correspond to entire words or morphemes. For instance, the Chinese words **由于** (because of) and **鱿鱼** (squid) have the same pronunciation: *yóuyú*.

Pangrams are grammatical sentences in which each character is used at least once. However, in many writing systems, characters have more than one form. For instance, in Latin-derived alphabets, all of the letters have both *MAJUSCULE* and *miniscule* forms. This is annoying, and means that even if we learn an English pangram like "the quick fox jumps over a lazy dog", we still haven't learned every form that the letters can take.



### Georgian Mkhedruli (მხედრული)

Things aren't always so annoying. In Georgian, you don't need to worry about differing character forms, because there aren't any! Georgian is one of the only writing systems in which a short pangram can be written that uses every letter and every letter-form:

> ჭოპორტელმა ყარაჩოღელმა ვაჟიკამ ძუნწ და ცოფიან ათაბაგს ქაჯი შეხერეზადა წაჰგვარა

This pangram is pronounced *"stsrafi kavisferi mela gadaakhta zarmatz dzaghls"* and means *"blah blah blah blah blah blah blah."* It's a bit of a mouthful, but if you're able to remember each word's pronunciation, you'll be able to read Georgian! In English, because of its opaque spelling and annoying bicameral capitalization system, sometimes a *ROSE* is not a *rows*. In Georgian, however, if you order a boquet of **ვარდები**, you'll never have to worry about the florist being confused by your spelling. The next writing system on the list is also easy to learn and create pangrams in, although it functions on a different basic logic.



### Korean Hangul (한글)

The Korean alphabet Hangul, like English and Georgian, has characters that correspond to individual consonants or vowels. Unlike other alphabets, Korean characters are squished together into blocks. This is an awesome advantage because it makes syllable boundaries easy to interpret. The word **김치** (kimchi) has two syllables, **김** and **치**. Unlike Chinese, each of these blocky units can be broken down into different letters. The **김** syllable consists of the letters **ㄱ** = *k (g)*, **ㅣ** = *i*, and **ㅁ** = *m*.

Like Georgian, it's easy to create a pangram that contains all the letters of the alphabet:

> 밤새 컴퓨터로 요약을 해치우면 좋겠다.

This pangram is pronounced *"BamSae KumPyooTuhRo YoYakEul HaeChiWooMyun JotGetDa"* and means *"I'd love to blaze through the summary with the computer overnight."*

However, there's a small hitch. Because Korean characters are all squeezed into super-convenient syllable blocks, they get warped slightly depending on their location in the block. Our letter **ㄱ** (*g*) is different when it's in the syllable **길** (*gil*, road), **굴** (*gool*, oyster), and **궐** (*gwol*, palace):

For a typographer creating a new font, the flexibility of Korean letters might be a nightmare. But for a language learner this flexibility doesn't cause much difficulty. In fact, Korean is one of the easiest writing systems to learn.



### Japanese Hiragana (ひらがな)

Japanese is written with several different scripts, all used in combination. One of these is hiragana, a syllabary. Hiragana characters usually follow root words written in Chinese characters (kanji), where they serve grammatical purposes such as inflecting verbs. But hiragana is powerful enough to represent all of spoken Japanese: small hiragana characters called furigana are sometimes written next to obscure kanji characters or in children's books to aid understanding.

![]({{ site.url }}/img/furigana.png)

Hiragana is almost a pure syllabary, except for a few hacks that are included in order to represent palatal sounds, nasal consonants, and some voiced consonants.

#### Hacks

While a word like **おとこ** is easily dissolved into its three syllables (*o.to.ko*), a word like **ちゃ** (tea, pron. *cha*) is hacked together with two characters. The first character, **ち**, makes the sound *chi* when it's alone or followed by another normal-sized hiragana character. The second character, **や**, is pronounced as *ya*. However, when **や** is written in a smaller form, the preceding character gets bundled up with it and forms a digraph (notice the difference between **ちゃ** = *cha* and **ちや** = *chiya*).

The nasal coda **ん** (*n*) can also be tacked on to any syllable. For instance, the syllable **や** (*ya*) becomes **やん** (*yan*) with the addition of the *n* character. In a very strict sense, the existense of **ん** means that hiragana is an alphasyllabary[^999 technly a moraic]. However, humans have had a tough time creating pure syllabaries, so hiragana gets a pass.

The third hack that hiragana uses are diacritics. Some syllables, like **ひ** (*hi*), take on marks that change their pronunciation: **ぴ** = *pi* and **び** = *pu*. In this way, hiragana behaves in a similar fashion to Devanagari, an abugida, where all syllables have base forms that are modified by diacritics. And this makes sense, because hiragana is probably descended from Siddham, a Brahmic script (like Devanagari) that was brought to Japan from India by Buddhist priests.

#### A Historical Aside

Hiragana's Indian origins are apparent. Not only do the ordering of hiragana characters resemble the ordering of Devanagari characters (more on that later), but Siddham, the Brahmic script that hiragana probably originates from, is still used by Shingon priests to write their Sanskrit mantras.

In fact, the Iroha, a well-known 11th century Shingon Buddhist poem, is a perfect hiragana pangram[^999], one that doesn't re-use any characters[^999]:

##### Iroha

|:-----------|:----------:|-----------:|
|いろ は にほへと |Iro ha nihoheto |Even the blossoming flowers |
|ちりぬる を |Chirinuru wo |Will eventually scatter |
|わ か よ たれ そ |Wa ka yo tare so |Who in our world |
|つね ならむ |Tsune naramu |Is unchanging? |
|うゐ の おくやま |Uwi no okuyama |The deep mountains of karma— |
|けふ こえて |Kefu koete |We cross them today |
|あさき ゆめ みし |Asaki yume mishi |And we shall not have superficial dreams |
|ゑひ も せす |Wehi mo sesu |Nor be deluded. |

The English translation[^999] is worth a read:

>Although its scent still lingers on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the form of a flower has scattered away<br>
For whom will the glory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this world remain unchanged?<br>
Arriving today at the yonder side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the deep mountains of evanescent existence<br>
We shall never allow ourselves to drift away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intoxicated, in the world of shallow dreams.

#### Hiragana Pangram

While the Iroha is a lovely pangram, it's a bit dated. Some of the characters, like **ゐ** and **ゑ**, have dropped out of use. Others, like **む**, have changed their pronunciation. A more modern pangram (though it still contains some obsolete characters) is below:

> とりなくこゑす ゆめさませ みよあけわたる ひんかしを そらいろはえて おきつへに ほふねむれゐぬ もやのうち

It's pronounced *"torinakukowesu yumesamase miyoakewataru hinkashiwo sorairohaete okitsuheni hofunemurewinu moyanōchi"* and means "Awaken from dreaming to the voice of the crying bird and see the coming daylight turning the east sky-blue; shrouded in mist is a flock of ships on the open sea."[^999]

While Hirigana might be one of the easiest syllabaries to learn, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to writing Japanese. Not only does Japanese have another parallel syllabary (katakana), but Japanese also uses thousands of Chinese logograms. These logograms have multiple written forms and come packaged with complex rules governing how their pronunciation changes based on context. 

Gupta empire - golden age  -  its legacy included chess, zero, and sanskrit literature, round earth Vatsyayana, 10 numeral system, kama sutra, 


kukai invented kana and iroha ... maybe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%ABkai

Buddhist practice, Kūkai had a dream, in which a man appeared and told Kūkai that the Mahavairocana Tantra is the scripture which contained the doctrine Kūkai was seeking.[1] Though Kūkai soon managed to obtain a copy of this sūtra which had only recently become available in Japan, he immediately encountered difficulty. Much of the sūtra was in untranslated Sanskrit written in the Siddhaṃ script. Kūkai found the translated portion of the sūtra was very cryptic.


### Arabic (العربية)

Like Korean, Arabic letters change their form based on their location in a word. However, the changes that Arabic letters undergo are much more dramatic. Every Arabic letter has an isolated, initial, medial, and final form (although sometimes these forms are the same). For instance, the letter *k* can appear four ways: **ك** = isolated, **كـ** = initial, **ـكـ** = medial, and **ـك** = final. Below are some examples of **ك** used in words:

The mutability of its characters makes finding satisfying pangrams in Arabic a bit difficult. Should we go the way of English, and simply ignore some letter forms and prioritize others? Or should we try to hack together a pangram that uses every form its letters take?

> نص حكيم له سر قاطع وذو شأن عظيم مكتوب على ثوب أخضر ومغلف بجلد أزرق

This is pronounced *"naṣun ḥakymun lahu syrun qāṭiʿun wa ḏu šānin ʿẓymin maktubun ʿala ṯubin aẖḍra wa muġalafun biǧildin azraq"*[^999 arab romnz] and means "A wise text which has an absolute secret and great importance, written on a green tissue and covered with blue leather."[^999]

I haven't found a pangram that will solve the multiple-forms problem. But that's okay, because the next writing system on the list will have some interesting organizational properties of its own.



### Devanagari (देवनागरी)

Devanagari is not the oldest writing system. Not free from flaws. It isn't the Brahmic abugida that spawned the profulgate family tree of Brahmic scripts. But these flaws only add to its importance, because coded into Devanagari is the key that would unlock the modern science of linguistics, a key that was passed to it from the ancient Brahmins


 Diacritic marks indicate the other vowels, anusvara, and visarga. A virama

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_transmission_of_Buddhism

China was later reached by the Indian form of tantra "esoteric Buddhism" (Vajrayana) in the 7th century. Tibetan Buddhism was likewise established as a branch of Vajrayana, in the 8th century. But from about this time, the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism began to decline with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana, resulting in the Uyghur Khaganate by the 740s.[7]

^ Arabic meets the Brahmic scripts!

virama killer stroke : similar to sukun circle diacritic in Arabic
If this k क् is further followed by another consonant letter, for example, ṣa ष, the result might look like क्‌ष, which represents kṣa as ka + (visible) virama + ṣa. In this case, two elements k क् and ṣa ष are simply placed one by one, side by side. Alternatively, kṣa can be also written as a ligature क्ष, which is actually the preferred form.

Anusvara = nasal "dot"


some of the same problems with forming pangrams in arabic are also present in devanagari. In the strictest sense, you would need to include not only all the base syllables, but also all syllables with vowel-modifying diacritics. On top of that. you'll have to include all of the language's ligatures ... 

syllable supremacy - all our letters have syllabic names: when we want to name the letter **S** we don't just hiss like a snake (*sssss*); instead we call this letter *es*.  It's possible to pronounce most consonants without the need of an adjacent vowel (exceptions include plosives like *k* and *b*)

similar to japanese ordering! historical connection??? (Buddhism?)

english is a one-dimensional list, but Devanagari is 2D!!!


### Chinese (漢字)

too bad! reflect on how certain writing systems are tailored to their languages, but languages with complex syllables (Mycenean Greek) demanded the invention of alphabets, which are by their nature more flexible


Chinese is an example of a system that's simple in principle but unweildly in practice. It's like one of those late-night debates you might have in college: *hey man, why don't we just abolish the police, we can all just work things out like we do in the dorms.* On a limited scale the principle couldn't be simpler: one word, one symbol, one pronunciation. However, when you begin to scale things up, the system gets annoying. Abolishing the police might be an okay idea on a college campus that has counsellors, faculty, and security staff, but it doesn't work when scaled up to all of the United States. Logograms might be appealing when you have only a few words, but actual languages have tens of thousands of words. 



### Weaving Everything Together

conclusion: pangrams are best suited for alphabets. It's also easy for Japanese, as the language *lucks out* by having a simple syllable structure. 

Korean is the best writing system in the context of its language: transparent syllables are a huge advantage.

Georgian is the best writing system in the context of world languages, because it can be adapted to any writing system and doesn't have useless capitals -- however, the syllables aren't transparent.

Here's my attempt at an English pangram:

> Waxy fish pangrams blaze, Jake equivocated.

The English alphabet is organized in one dimension, a single string that starts with `a` and ends with `z`. Hindi, on the other hand, is much more interesting. Devenagari is organized along two dimensions, manner and place of articulation, a structural organization which underlies our modern understanding of phonology.

#### A Note about the IPA

Before you read the following tables, it's important to have an understanding of the IPA. blah blah. Useful for both language learning and seeing the similarities between different languages.



The following sections contain acrostic tables for Georgian, Korean, and Devanagari. I've writted previous posts about [Japanese]({{ site.url }}/articles/2014-01/japanese-syllables) and [Arabic]({{ sire.url }}/articles/2016-04/kurdish-alphabet). 



### Acrostic Tables

#### Georgian



#### Korean



#### Devanagari

Devanagari characters are written independently before being connected with a vertical line that runs along their tops. Most characters connect to their neighbors; however, like in Arabic, there are a few `interrupting characters`. Examples of each of the primary 61 Devanagari characters are shown below:
