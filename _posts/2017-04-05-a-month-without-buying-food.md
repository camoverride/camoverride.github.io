I've been dumpster diving for food for the past two years and have gotten quite good at it. Dumpster diving isn't a skill like riding a bike: it's something more like a philosophy or mode of living. If you want to fully embrace dumpster diving, it requires modifying your lifestyle in subtle but important ways. These modifications include scouting, scavenging, and preserving.

*Scouting* means pausing while going about your daily routine to explore. This might mean circling around behind a Target to examine its dumpsters before going inside to do your shopping. Scouting doesn't come naturally. We're funneled into certain modes of interacting with the world around us: we walk towards the large, inviting front doors of a shopping center instead of the dingy, secluded delivery-area even though this is where the treasure is buried.

*Scavenging* is the actual act of collecting food. Dumpster diving doesn't have to involve literally diving into dumpsters. I generally visit stores that leave their trash in smaller baskets or dumpsters that are filled high enough that I can extract food without having to jump inside. Scavenging is probably the easiest part of dumpster diving: bring a bag, maybe a pair of gloves, and be prepared to awkwardly jog away if anyone sees you.

*Preserving* is how a dumpster diver deals with the uneven distribution of their scavengings. One week I might find $200 worth of fancy cheeses (as I recently did), and another week huge boxes of peppers. Preservation might be as simple as putting a food in the freezer (as is the case with fancy cheeses); however, things can get more complicated. When I find red bell peppers, I usually fry them into a food called [ajvar](), which, in addition to being delicious, has a long shelf-life. In practice, I collect more food than I can eat or preserve, so much of it gets funneled to my friends.

After moving to San Jose late last month and discovering a few promising dumpsters to scavenge from, I decided to impose a challenge on myself: I won't purchase any food for the month of April. I relocated to San Jose for work, and my company has plenty of free food in the office. To offset this, for every free meal I eat at the office, I'll be cooking one for my friends.

I don't expect that this challenge will be all that challenging. About 75% of my current diet is dumpster dived, the remaining 25% being meals I eat out with friends. However, it'll be more of a proof-of-concept: I want to demonstrate a young adult with a full-time job and normal social life can spend zero money on food and get on just fine. If April is a success, I might expand this experiment through the spring and summer -- but I'll have to post an update about that as things unfold.
