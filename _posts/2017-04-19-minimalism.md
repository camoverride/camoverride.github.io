Minimalism is a trend in Silicon Valley. People are obsessed with reducing their number of personal belongings in favor of (hopefully) a greater emphasis on social interaction but (more likely) a greater emphasis on Github commits. A minimalist lifestyle by itself doesn't mean much: you have to peek beneath the surface and see what's motivating a person's minimalism.

Some minimalists are motivated by an opposition to materialism. They view matter as being confining, cumbersome, and restrictive. They believe that the spirit and intellect can transcend the corrupt material of the physical world. They read Hesse, Kerouac, and Eco and have probably dabbled in esoterism while they were in college. They're covert Gnostics.

Some minimalists are 'minimalizing.' They find their possessions to be anxiety-provoking and lash out against them. Many minimalizing minimalists are compulsive, easily-distracted, and nervous. Unlike the Gnostics, this group doesn't believe in the superiority of mind over matter. Rather, they are upset by a particular kind of matter and will seek to create distance between themselves and the object of their disaffection. These are the sort of people that bite their fingernails and organize their books alphabetically. Their minimalism is emotional, not logical.

The third group of minimalists are radicals. Like the Gnostics, they see matter as corrupt. However, they don't believe themselves to be transcendent above matter. In their view, private property is an instrument of oppression, classism, and tyranny. Their minimalism is only transitory: once a better method for distributing property is invented, it will no longer be their anathema. Unlike the mimilizers, they are cooly rational. They are Marxists, Left-Anarchists, or members of religious groups. Once they graduate from college, they'll either transform into one of the other categories of minimalist or find a job.

Some people seek wisdom or clarity be seperating themselves from things that bring them pleasure. This group, the Ascetics, practives self-denial by eliminating possessions. Like the Gnostics, they elevate knowledge (Gnosis) above the pleasures of the flesh. These two groups diverge because whereas Gnostics are motivated by rational or cognitive ideas about transcendence, the ascetics are more greatly motivated by emotion. Their rejection of property is more coincidental than intentional: possessions are just one thing among many others (sex, food, blogs) that brings pleasure.

The last group of minimalists are the Lifestylists. They're people motivated by practical considerations. Many are Freegans, hippies, and rule-breakers. They liked playing with matches when they were children. They mostly empathize with the other four groups of minimalists, but aren't motivated enough to stay faithful to any one cause. Unlike the other minimalists, Lifestylists sometimes have belongings. Lifestylists differ from hoarders because they're not attached to their belongings: they're only around for practical purposes, and will be discarded the next time the Lifestylist moves into a new apartment or finds a new girlfriend.

I'm a Lifestylist. I agree with the radicals, except when I'm forced to talk to other radicals, and during pretentious moments I find common ground with the Gnostics. I'm a minimalist because I don't get a whole lot of happiness out of my belongings.
