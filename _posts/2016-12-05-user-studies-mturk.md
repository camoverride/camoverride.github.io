[Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) is an extremely useful resource for conducting basic human research. It allows researchers to quickly gather data from large numbers of participants at a very low cost. MTurk's built-in platform is generally used for conducting surveys; however, I find MTurk more useful as a recruiting platform. After recruiting participants, I can then redirect them to a website I've created that hosts the user study.

However, some scientists have criticized MTurk for its lack of transparency. It's not always easy to confirm whether participants are lying about certain background criteria. For instance, I've conducted several language-learning studies using MTurk where native fluency in English is important. While MTurk is useful for initial hypothesis-testing in language studies, it isn't particularly reliable for longer-term studies where language fluency is critical.

## Head Direction and Attractiveness

But language-learning is only one category of research that I'm interested in. Other areas of research, such as perceptual studies, are robust to demographic variables such as language-fluency. Recently I've been curious about the influence of head-direction on measures of attraction, trustworthiness, and assessment of value. Researchers have known for a while that people have systematic lateral spatial biases. These biases include a preference for objects on the right sides of space[^1], a liking for visual scenes that move from left to right (or visa versa following writing direction),[^2] and well-documented aversions to left-handedness in many cultures[^3].

I wanted to see whether people have a similar bias for head directions. I found 120 images: 40 with heads in three-quarters view facing right, 40 facing left, and 40 looking forward. I presented the images to different participants in their naturally-occurring orientation and flipped horizontally and asked participants to rate the images for attractiveness. Although I'm still scraping through the data, it seems that people tend to have a preference for heads facing towards the right, exposing the left side of the face.

This is very interesting, because it seems to suggest that advertisers could increase the likeability of their advertisements by simple flipping them. For instance, in the cropped Coca-Cola advertisement below, participants preferred the reversed image on the right over the original image on the left.

Producing a professional advertisement can cost tens of thousands of dollars[^4], but conducting a simple Mechanical Turk study is so cheap that I can do it as a hobby. Perhaps companies should take a more research-oriented approach to advertising, accounting for well-known psychological preferences before revealing their ads. After all, the cost of horizontally flipping an image is free.
